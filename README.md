# The Teleport Coding Challenge

*A guide to porting the Mazes of Menace from C to JavaScript, for
adventurers traveling with a small swarm of LLM coding assistants.*

NetHack is one of the longest-lived and most peculiar open source
programs ever written. After 46 years of continuous development —
tracing its lineage from Rogue (1980) to Hack (1982) to NetHack —
v5.0 just shipped: the first major version bump since 3.0 in 1989.
That's 442,901 lines of C and Lua to port. The dungeon is deep and
the corridors twist.

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to fork this repository
and produce a JavaScript implementation whose external behavior is
*indistinguishable* from upstream NetHack 5.0. Bit-exact. Same PRNG
sequence, same terminal output, frame for frame, byte for byte, all
the way down to which random newt corpse you trip over on Dlvl 3.

You may use any tools you can muster: AI agents, hand-coding,
transpilers, monks chanting in caves. The contest's hypothesis is
that **the magic is in the LLM methods, not the code itself**. If
your method works, sharing the code costs you nothing. If it doesn't,
no one was going to copy your code anyway.

*You feel deep wisdom for a moment. You hear bubbling water somewhere
in the distance.* Let's begin.

## How

1. **Fork this repo.** It's a playable NetHack skeleton with the PRNG
   and terminal already wired up. The `js/` directory contains the
   game logic — almost none of it, in fact. That's the point.
2. **Read the C.** The full NetHack 5.0 source lives upstream at
   [NetHack/NetHack](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack) (tag
   `NetHack-5.0.0_Release`, also pulled in here as a submodule at
   `nethack-c/upstream/`). Read it. Implement the equivalent in
   `js/`. Faithfully — including its bugs, its quirks, and its
   forty-six years of accumulated tradition.
3. **Push.** GitHub Actions on your fork scores you on every push
   against 44 public sessions — fast feedback in your own Actions
   minutes. Every two hours, the official judge re-scores the
   latest commit on every fork against all 88 sessions (44 public
   and 44 held-out) and updates the leaderboard.
4. **Climb.** Both up the leaderboard, and metaphorically toward
   the Amulet of Yendor. Mostly the leaderboard.

## Quick start

```bash
gh repo fork davidbau/teleport-contest --clone --remote
cd teleport-contest
git submodule update --init    # pulls in nethack-c/upstream

# Play the skeleton in your browser
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/

# Score locally against all 44 public sessions
bash frozen/score.sh
```

Out of the box, the skeleton scores partial credit on
`seed8000-tourist-starter` — its `fastforward.js` replay nails most
of the early-game PRNG and the first dozen-or-so screens. That's
your hello world: getting it from "partial" to "full pass," and
then taking on the other 87 sessions.

## What's in this repo

Three things, layered like the Dungeons of Doom themselves.

### 1. A skeleton port of NetHack 5.0

A minimal JavaScript implementation that runs through the first short
tourist game (`seed8000-tourist-starter`) far enough to render a few
recognizable screens. It does NOT pass that session yet — chargen is
unimplemented, and the skeleton "fakes" the early game by replaying a
hardcoded sequence of PRNG draws read out of the recorded session
(see `js/fastforward.js`). It's enough scaffolding to see the engine
move; it's not enough to score. Treat it as the surface layer:
gentle, well-mapped, populated almost entirely with grid bugs. You
will have to dig.

**Where the code lives:**

```
js/
├── jsmain.js          ← contest entry point; exports runSegment
├── isaac64.js         ← FROZEN: canonical PRNG engine. Don't touch.
├── terminal.js        ← FROZEN: 24×80 grid + serialize(). Don't touch.
├── storage.js         ← FROZEN: VFS for save/restore + bones. Don't touch.
├── rng.js             ← PRNG wrappers (rn2, rnd, d, …). Edit freely.
├── fastforward.js     ← Hardcoded RNG-replay scaffolding for seed8000.
│                        A trap to escape — see below.
├── nethack.js         ← top-level NetHack class. Mostly a stub.
├── const.js           ← 2,000+ constants imported from upstream headers.
├── allmain.js         ← the move loop. Currently very polite.
├── cmd.js             ← command dispatch. Knows about ~5 commands.
├── display.js         ← screen rendering. Renders some things.
├── mklev.js           ← level generation. Almost entirely unwritten.
├── input.js           ← input handling. Partially wired.
└── …
```

**Run it locally:**

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000   # any static server works
open http://localhost:8000/
```

There's no chargen prompt yet — the skeleton skips straight into the
game with a hardcoded character because `js/fastforward.js` replays
the PRNG calls that real chargen would produce. You'll see a small
room and a tourist. Move around a few squares. Watch your
`js/jsmain.js` get exercised in real time.

**A brief tour:** start in `js/jsmain.js` to see the contest API
entry point, then follow the call chain into `js/nethack.js` →
`js/allmain.js` → `js/cmd.js`. The actual game logic to fill in is
mostly under `js/mklev.js`, `js/cmd.js`, and a long list of files that
don't exist yet but need to (`js/mon.js`, `js/dog.js`, `js/spell.js`,
etc. — a complete NetHack port has on the order of 80 source files).

**About `fastforward.js`:** it's a hardcoded list of `rn2(N)` calls
that fakes the RNG sequence for `seed8000` only. It will never
generalize and it will never pass a held-out session. The path
forward is to delete its entries one at a time, replacing each with
the real C function port that produces those calls naturally.

The skeleton is "what works without porting much." Everything beyond
is yours to build. *Be careful, ahead.*

### 2. Patches to make C NetHack deterministic

Your goal is to clone the behavior of NetHack 5.0 exactly. But for
the contest to score that, the C side has to produce the same output
every time it runs — not depend on the system clock, not depend on
the libc's `qsort` tie-breaking, not write straight to ncurses where
nothing is captured. So this repo includes a patched build of NetHack
5.0 that introduces two new environment variables you can pin:

- **`NETHACK_SEED`** — seeds the PRNG. Same seed → same dungeon, same
  monsters, same loot.
- **`NETHACK_FIXED_DATETIME`** — sets the date and time of play
  (format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`). NetHack uses the wall clock for moon
  phase, hire dates, shopkeeper greetings, and the Friday-the-13th
  luck penalty; pinning the datetime makes all of these reproducible.

Plus changes to log every PRNG call (so you can see what C consumed
and in what order), to capture the 24×80 terminal as a deterministic
stream (not curses), and to swap in a stable sort. Eight patches total.

The C source is organized like this:

```
nethack-c/
├── upstream/                   ← git submodule pinned to NetHack 5.0.0_Release
│                                 (clean upstream from github.com/NetHack/NetHack)
├── patches/                    ← the eight deterministic-build patches:
│   ├── 001-deterministic-runtime.patch        — NETHACK_SEED + NETHACK_FIXED_DATETIME
│   ├── 002-deterministic-qsort.patch          — stable sort
│   ├── 003-rng-log-core.patch                 — log core PRNG calls
│   ├── 004-rng-log-lua-context.patch          — tag Lua-side PRNG calls
│   ├── 005-rng-display-logging.patch          — log the display PRNG (hallucination)
│   └── 006-008-nomux-*.patch                  — capture 24×80 terminal stream
├── build-recorder.sh           ← clones submodule, applies patches, builds binary
├── macosx-minimal              ← macOS hints file (upstream doesn't ship one)
├── README.md                   ← deeper notes on each patch
└── recorder/                   ← gitignored — built source tree + binary appears here
```

Yes, NetHack has **three independent PRNG contexts** — core gameplay,
Lua-script (for special levels), and display (for hallucination
effects). Patches 003-005 instrument all three. Your JS port has to
reproduce all three, in the right order, with the right values. PRNG
parity is the foundation: a single off-by-one RNG call cascades through
the entire dungeon and nothing else can match. But getting the random
numbers right doesn't get you the screens — that's a separate, harder
problem. The screens are where most of NetHack actually lives: the
message line, the map draws, the inventory menus, the prompts, the
cursor dance, the forty-six years of accumulated terminal handling.
Most contestants' time will be spent there.

**Build the recorder:**

```bash
git submodule update --init nethack-c/upstream
bash nethack-c/build-recorder.sh
```

This clones the submodule (NetHack 5.0.0_Release source from
github.com/NetHack/NetHack), applies the eight patches into
`nethack-c/recorder/`, and builds the binary at
`nethack-c/recorder/install/games/lib/nethackdir/nethack`. The
`recorder/` directory is gitignored — it's built artifact, not source.

You do NOT need to do this to enter the contest. The 44 sessions in
`sessions/` were recorded with this build and ship ready to score
against. Build the recorder only if you want to record your own
debugging sessions or generate supplemental coverage (see
`PROMPT.md` Parts 2 and 4).

Requires: `clang` (not gcc — see below), `make`, `bison`, `flex`.

**Why clang specifically:** C's argument evaluation order is
officially undefined. In practice, gcc evaluates right-to-left and
clang evaluates left-to-right. A single innocent line like
`d(rn2(5), rn2(3))` consumes RNG calls in opposite orders depending
on the compiler — completely scrambling the entire PRNG sequence.
We pin to clang so the recorder's behavior is reproducible across
machines, and the JS port (which evaluates left-to-right) can match
it. *If you build with gcc, your dungeon will look correct but every
random number will be wrong. You sense the presence of an unfortunate
compiler.*

### 3. A pile of recorded delvings to score against

Forty-four recorded sessions live in `sessions/` as `*.session.json`.
Each is a complete game (or a chain of games) played from chargen to
wherever it ended, with the PRNG sequence and screen output of the C
recorder captured at every input boundary. They are the standard
against which your port is measured: same input, same output, or you
fail.

**Run them locally:**

```bash
bash frozen/score.sh                             # score all 44
node frozen/ps_test_runner.mjs sessions/seed8000-tourist-starter.session.json
                                                 # score one
```

You'll get a report like:

```
seed8000-tourist-starter        PASS  RNG: 22/22       Screen: 23/23
seed0007-rogue-snake-swamp      FAIL  RNG: 391/3706 (10.5%)   div@392
…
```

**The challenge, in one sentence.** You get about 10,000 game
keystrokes (the recorded input across the 44 public sessions). For
every one of those keystrokes, can your JS port render the exact
same 24×80 terminal screen the C reference produced? Each matching
screen is one point. Public corpus has 10,982 screens — that's your
public maximum.

A session that diverges at step 50 still earns 50 screen points;
you don't have to pass a whole session to score, and you don't have
to start at the beginning to make progress. Each step's screen is
checked independently after the recorded input has been replayed up
to that point.

**Then 10,000 more, unseen.** After your fork has been scored on
the public set, the judge runs another ~10,000 keystrokes from the
held-out pool — sessions you never see, only the judge has them.
Match those screens too and you've shown your port has comprehensive
coverage of the game, not just the corner of it the public sessions
exercise. A faithful port scores comparably on both pools; a port
that secretly hardcoded the public traces falls off a cliff on
held-out.

PRNG sequence matching is the structural prerequisite (your PRNG
calls have to align with C's call-by-call before any screen can
match), but PRNG matches alone don't earn points — the leaderboard
publishes your PRNG match percentage as advisory progress next to
the screen score.

If top scores cluster too tightly to distinguish the strongest
entrants, additional and harder held-out sessions will be added over
the summer (see `docs/PHASES.md`). Plan accordingly.

**The 2-hour cron:** the judge auto-discovers every fork of
`davidbau/teleport-contest` on GitHub. When you push to your fork,
the next cron firing (within two hours) will pick up your latest
commit and score it. Your row on the leaderboard at
[mazesofmenace.ai](https://mazesofmenace.ai/leaderboard/) updates
shortly after.

You don't need to do anything special to "submit." Forking and pushing
is the entire protocol. There is no application form, no submission
button, no email to send. The dungeon notices when you arrive.

*Welcome to NetHack. Good luck, and have fun.*

## The Teleport Contest

### Scoring API

Your fork must export `runSegment(input, prevGame=null)` from
`js/jsmain.js`. The full contract is in [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md);
the short version is that for each game segment, you receive a seed,
a datetime, an `OPTIONS=…` rc-text blob, and a string of keys. You
return an object whose `getScreens()`, `getRngLog()`, and
`getCursors()` methods can be read back at the end. The recorded
ground truth is never passed in. You can't peek at the answer key.
You have to actually port the game.

Two channels are scored, both required:

- **P (PRNG):** every `rn2`/`rnd`/`d`/`rn1`/`rne`/`rnz`/`rnl` call
  must return the same value in the same order as C.
- **S (Screen):** the 24×80 terminal output at each input boundary
  must match C's display, byte-for-byte (after a small charset and
  SGR canonicalization that forgives the terminal's many ways of
  saying "draw a space").

**Scoring is per-step, screens-only.** Your score is the count of
steps where the captured 24×80 grid matches C's exactly (character +
color + attribute + cursor position). The 44 public sessions contain
10,982 steps (max 10,982 points). The 44 held-out pool adds 10,631
more steps (max 10,631 more) for a global maximum of 21,613 points.

PRNG match is the structural prerequisite — if your PRNG diverges
from C's, the game state diverges and screens can't match — but
PRNG matches alone don't score points. The leaderboard publishes
your PRNG match percentage as advisory progress.

### What's frozen

Two files in your fork are overlaid from the canonical copy before
every scoring run:

| File | Why frozen |
|---|---|
| `js/isaac64.js` | The canonical PRNG. Frozen so every contestant draws from the same number stream the C recorder did, and per-call results align bit-for-bit. |
| `js/terminal.js` | The canonical 24×80 grid. Defines what counts as "the screen" — which is itself a non-trivial question once you start thinking about it. |
| `js/storage.js` | The canonical VFS contract for save files, bones, and the topten record. `localStorage` in the browser, `InMemoryStorage` in the Node sandbox. Frozen so multi-segment sessions (save+restore, bones, chained `#quit`) have a well-defined isolation: state persists across segments within one session, resets between sessions. |

That is the entire fixed surface. Everything else in `js/` —
including `jsmain.js`, `rng.js`, `display.js`, `const.js` — is yours
to edit, replace, or restructure. Burn the skeleton down and
rebuild it if that helps you. (Many roles have done so. Few have
ascended.)

### Rules

- **Any approach is allowed.** LLM agents, manual coding, hybrid,
  transpilers, the aforementioned chanting monks — whatever produces
  the right output. The two-phase design specifically rewards
  generalization, so handcrafted solutions face strong headwind in
  Phase 2.
- **Submissions must be plain JavaScript.** ES6 modules, runnable
  as-is in both Node 22+ and modern Chrome. No build step required.
  No WASM, no internet or filesystem or threads, no native addons.
  Persistent state goes through the frozen `js/storage.js` VFS;
  everything else stays in-process.
- **Frozen files cannot be modified.** The judge overlays them on
  every scoring run, so editing them locally only fools your local
  score, not the leaderboard.
- **Sandboxed scoring.** Your code runs in a Node child process with
  `--permission` and a minimal `--allow-fs-read` whitelist: no file
  writes, no network sockets, no `child_process`, no native addons.
  Don't try to escape the sandbox. The dungeon has lived through
  better attempts than yours.
- **Public source code.** All forks are public on GitHub. Anyone can
  read your code, your prompts, your agent harness. That's by design.
  If your method is so good it produces winning code, sharing the
  code doesn't compromise your method. If you'd rather not show your
  work in public, this isn't your contest.

### Two phases

This is a journey in two parts.

**Phase 1 — Foundation.** Deadline Sunday Nov 29, 2026 (00:00 UTC,
the Sunday after US Thanksgiving). A standard parity contest against
NetHack 5.0. Top 10 teams by score qualify for Phase 2. Everyone
else is welcome to keep submitting after the deadline, but only the
top 10 compete in the second phase.

**Phase 2 — Generalization.** Target announced Nov 30; deadline
Dec 31, 2026 (00:00 UTC). The judges pick a "5.1" — a slightly newer
C codebase, perhaps a real upstream release, perhaps a designated
post-5.0 commit, perhaps a small judge-curated patch set. Your Phase
2 score is parity against 5.1, **divided by** a penalty proportional
to how much you changed your `js/` from your Phase 1 submission.

The point: hand-tuned ports get crushed by 5.1 because they overfit
to the exact 5.0 code paths. Methods that generalize win. Or, in
NetHack terms: the player who memorized the layout of the Castle
does not necessarily survive Gehennom.

Full mechanics in [`docs/PHASES.md`](docs/PHASES.md).

## Prizes

- **Top 10 from Phase 1** — qualification for Phase 2 and a
  spotlight on the leaderboard.
- **Phase 2 winner** — highest combined parity-divided-by-diff score
  against the 5.1 target. Bragging rights, durable place on the
  leaderboard, and the satisfaction of having ported NetHack twice.
- **Best Method award** — judged separately on the quality and
  reproducibility of your team's writeup. You don't need to win
  Phase 2 outright to win the method prize. The contest's long-term
  value is the techniques people share, not the ranking.
- **Spotlights** — throughout both phases, judges may spotlight any
  team's pipeline writeup on the leaderboard. Write up your agent
  harness, your prompts, your evaluation loop, the parts that
  surprised you, the parts you would do differently — link from your
  fork's README and we'll feature the most interesting ones.

## Leaderboard

**[mazesofmenace.ai](https://mazesofmenace.ai/)**

Updates every two hours. Public scores recompute on every push;
held-out scores update when the cron fires. The official upstream
skeleton is included as a baseline reference, currently scoring
0/88 — the floor from which everyone climbs. (For now.)

Just kidding. Nobody dies in this contest. The worst that happens is
the leaderboard says 0/88 for a while. That's also where everyone
starts.
